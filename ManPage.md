# Man Page

*What is a man page? Why is it useful? For what purpose does it serve?*

### What is it? (•᷄ὤ•᷅)？

> Short for **manual page**, the **man page** is a software documentation normally found on a Unix or Unix-based operating system. Topics covered by the man page is split into eight sections, organized as follows:

```
Section | Topics
--------| -------
1 | General commands
2 | System calls
3 | Library functions (mainly the *C standard library*)
4 | Special files and drivers
5 | File format and conventions
6 | Games and screensavers
7 | Miscellanea
8 | System administration commands and daemons
```

** Descriptions/notes about each topic: **

1. **Command** is a directive to a computer program acting as an interpreter in order to perform a specific task.
	* Ex: *ls*, *cd*, *echo* are known commands
2. **System call** is the programmatic way in which a computer program requests a service from the kernel of the operating system it is executed on.
	* Ex: *open*, *kill*, *exit* are known system calls
3. **Library** is a collection of non-volatile resources used by programs to develop software.
	* Ex: *iostream* and *string* are library functions of the C standard library
4. **Special file** is an interface for a device driver that appears in a file system as if it were an ordinary file. **Driver** is a program that operates or control a type of device attached to a computer. 
5. **File format** is a standard way that information is encoded for storage in a computer file. 
	* Ex: *.cpp*, *.h*, *.txt* are common file formats in C++ programming
6. This section describes all the **games** that are available on the system and provide command line tools for controlling the **screensaver**. 
7. As implied. 
8. **Daemon** is a computer program that runs as a background process rather than being under the direct control of an inactive user. 
	* Ex: *sshd* is a daemond that services incoming SSH connections

**Note:** 

> The section order provided is accurate for **Research Unix**, **BSD**, **OS X**, and **Linux**.
> There is a **Unix System V**, originally developed by AT&T 1983, that is similar to this but is listed in a different order. 
> This documentation will focus on section 1-3 since it relates to the class materials.

### Layout:

> Each section, or page, of the man page follow a set layout, optimized for presentation on an ASCII text display without any form of highlighting or font control.
